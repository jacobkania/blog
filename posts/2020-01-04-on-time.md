Title: A comment on time
PublishedDate: 2020-01-04

Why have I spent so long working on many iterations of the same project? Why did I just jump in without planning first? Why am I prioritizing how to use my time, but getting it so wrong?

I was doing some thinking today, and those are the quick summary of my thoughts. I have projects that I really want to work on -- that I'm excited about -- but it seems like a challenge to get around to them. So I wonder, why is this?
